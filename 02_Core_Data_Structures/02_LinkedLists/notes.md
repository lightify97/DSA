Linked Lists
1. Introduction / Concept

Imagine a treasure hunt where each clue tells you where the next clue is. You don't know all the locations upfront, but you can always find the next one by following the current clue. This is the essence of a Linked List.

A Linked List is a linear data structure, just like an array. However, unlike arrays, elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, a linked list consists of a sequence of interconnected "nodes." Each node contains two parts:

Data (or Value): The actual information stored in the node.

Pointer (or Reference): A link to the next node in the sequence.

The first node in the list is called the Head, and it's the entry point to the entire list. The last node's pointer typically points to None (or null in other languages), signifying the end of the list.

Linked lists offer different trade-offs compared to arrays, especially concerning insertions and deletions.

2. Core Principles / Theory

Nodes: The fundamental building blocks. Each node is an object containing data and a reference to the next node.

(Imagine each node as a small box. Inside the box is a piece of data, and an arrow pointing to the next box.)

Head: The starting point of the linked list. To access any element, you must start from the head and traverse sequentially.

Tail: The last node in the list. Its next pointer is typically None (or null).

Dynamic Size: Linked lists can easily grow or shrink in size as needed, without the need for resizing and copying elements like dynamic arrays.

Non-contiguous Memory: Elements can be scattered anywhere in memory, as long as the pointers correctly link them.

Types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List:

Each node points only to its next node.

Traversal is only possible in one direction (forward).

(Diagram: Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> None)

Doubly Linked List:

Each node has two pointers: one to its next node and one to its previous node.

Allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.

More memory per node (for the extra pointer).

(Diagram: None <- Node1 <-> Node2 <-> Node3 -> None)

Circular Linked List:

The last node's pointer points back to the first node (the head), forming a circle.

Can be singly or doubly linked.

No None pointer to indicate the end.

(Diagram: Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> Node1 (circular)). Useful for continuous loops.

3. Operations / Methods
3.1. General Operations

Traversal: Visiting each node from head to tail.

Time: O(N) - Linear time. You must visit every node.

Space: O(1)

Search: Finding a node with a specific value.

Time: O(N) - Linear time. In the worst case, you might have to traverse the entire list.

Space: O(1)

Calculating Length: Traverse the list and count nodes.

Time: O(N)

Space: O(1)

3.2. Insertion Operations

Insertion at Head:

Create a new node.

Make the new node's next pointer point to the current head.

Update the list's head to be the new node.

Time: O(1) - Constant time.

Insertion at Tail:

If list is empty, new node becomes head.

Otherwise, traverse to the current tail.

Make the current tail's next pointer point to the new node.

Time: O(N) - Linear time (due to traversal to find tail). If you maintain a tail pointer, this becomes O(1).

Insertion After a Given Node:

Given a pointer to a node X, create new node Y.

Make Y.next point to X.next.

Make X.next point to Y.

Time: O(1) - Constant time.

3.3. Deletion Operations

Deletion at Head:

Update the list's head to be the current head's next node.

Time: O(1) - Constant time.

Deletion at Tail:

Requires traversing to the second-to-last node.

Make the second-to-last node's next pointer None.

Time: O(N) - Linear time (requires traversal to find second-to-last node).

Deletion of a Given Node (requires previous node):

Given a pointer to the node X to be deleted and a pointer to its prev_node:

Make prev_node.next point to X.next.

Time: O(1) - Constant time.

Deletion of a Given Value:

Requires traversing to find the node with the value and its previous node.

Time: O(N) - Linear time.

3.4. Specialized Operations

Reversal (In-place): Changing the direction of all pointers without extra space.

Time: O(N)

Space: O(1)

Cycle Detection: Determining if a cycle exists.

Time: O(N) (using Fast & Slow Pointers)

Space: O(1) (using Fast & Slow Pointers)

Finding Middle Node:

Time: O(N) (using Fast & Slow Pointers)

Space: O(1)

4. Python Implementation Details / Considerations
4.1. ListNode Class

A custom class is needed to represent nodes.

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val       # Data stored in the node
        self.next = next     # Reference to the next node (or None if it's the last)
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

For Doubly Linked Lists:

class DoublyListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, prev=None, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.prev = prev     # Reference to the previous node
        self.next = next     # Reference to the next node
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
4.2. Pointers as References

Python's variables store references to objects. When you assign node.next = new_node, you're simply changing which object node.next refers to. This makes pointer manipulation intuitive.

None is used to represent a null pointer, indicating the end of a list or an unassigned link.

4.3. Dummy Head Node (Sentinel Node)

For many linked list problems, especially those involving insertions or deletions at the head of the list, using a "dummy head" node (also called a sentinel node) can greatly simplify the code.

A dummy head is an extra node, typically with a placeholder value (e.g., 0), that points to the actual head of your list.

It avoids special casing for an empty list or operations that modify the head, as the actual list is always accessed via dummy_head.next.

(Imagine a starting gate for a race. The gate itself isn't a runner, but it's where all runners start from, simplifying setup.)

# Example of using a dummy head for list construction
def create_list_with_dummy(arr):
    dummy_head = ListNode(0) # The dummy node
    current = dummy_head
    for val in arr:
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
    return dummy_head.next # Return the actual head of the list
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Example: Merge Two Sorted Lists (LeetCode 21)

Given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2, merge the two lists into a single sorted list.

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def merge_two_lists(list1: ListNode, list2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    # Create a dummy node. This helps simplify the logic for adding the first element
    # and avoiding special handling for an empty merged list.
    dummy_head = ListNode(0) 
    
    # 'current' pointer will always point to the last node in our merged list.
    current = dummy_head

    # Iterate as long as both lists have nodes to compare.
    while list1 and list2:
        if list1.val <= list2.val:
            current.next = list1 # Append node from list1
            list1 = list1.next   # Advance list1's pointer
        else:
            current.next = list2 # Append node from list2
            list2 = list2.next   # Advance list2's pointer
        current = current.next   # Advance the 'current' pointer in the merged list
    
    # If one list still has remaining elements (the other is exhausted),
    # append the rest of that list to the merged list.
    if list1:
        current.next = list1
    elif list2:
        current.next = list2
        
    # The actual merged list starts from the node after the dummy head.
    return dummy_head.next

# Helper function to create a linked list from a list
def create_linked_list(arr: list) -> ListNode:
    if not arr:
        return None
    head = ListNode(arr[0])
    current = head
    for val in arr[1:]:
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
    return head

# Helper function to convert a linked list to a list for printing
def linked_list_to_list(head: ListNode) -> list:
    result = []
    current = head
    while current:
        result.append(current.val)
        current = current.next
    return result

# Edge Cases and Examples:
list1_a = create_linked_list([1,2,4])
list2_a = create_linked_list([1,3,4])
merged_a = merge_two_lists(list1_a, list2_a)
print(f"Merge [1,2,4] and [1,3,4]: {linked_list_to_list(merged_a)}") # Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

list1_b = None
list2_b = None
merged_b = merge_two_lists(list1_b, list2_b)
print(f"Merge [] and []: {linked_list_to_list(merged_b)}")           # Output: [] (Both empty)

list1_c = None
list2_c = create_linked_list([0])
merged_c = merge_two_lists(list1_c, list2_c)
print(f"Merge [] and [0]: {linked_list_to_list(merged_c)}")           # Output: [0] (One empty)

list1_d = create_linked_list([5])
list2_d = create_linked_list([1,2,3,4])
merged_d = merge_two_lists(list1_d, list2_d)
print(f"Merge [5] and [1,2,3,4]: {linked_list_to_list(merged_d)}")     # Output: [1,2,3,4,5] (One much shorter)
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START

Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Edge Cases Handled: Both lists empty, one list empty, lists of different lengths. The dummy_head simplifies initialization, and the final if/elif block correctly appends remaining elements.

5. Time and Space Complexity Analysis
Operation	Singly Linked List Time Complexity (Worst-Case)	Singly Linked List Space Complexity
Access by Index	O(N) (must traverse from head)	O(1)
Search by Value	O(N)	O(1)
Insert at Head	O(1)	O(1)
Insert at Tail	O(N) (unless tail pointer maintained, then O(1))	O(1)
Insert After Node	O(1)	O(1)
Delete at Head	O(1)	O(1)
Delete at Tail	O(N) (must find second-to-last node)	O(1)
Delete a Given Node (with prev)	O(1)	O(1)
Delete a Given Value	O(N)	O(1)
Reversal (In-place)	O(N)	O(1)
Cycle Detection	O(N)	O(1)
Find Middle Node	O(N)	O(1)

Doubly Linked List Specifics (compared to Singly):

Insert at Tail: O(1) (if tail pointer maintained).

Delete at Tail: O(1) (using tail.prev).

Delete a Given Node (without prev): O(1) (given node, can access node.prev).

Space: O(1) extra space per node (for the prev pointer). Total space is O(N) due to nodes.

6. Pros and Cons / Trade-offs
Pros:

Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink very efficiently at runtime. There's no need to pre-allocate memory or worry about resizing operations.

Efficient Insertions/Deletions (at known positions):

Inserting a node at the head is O(1).

Deleting the head node is O(1).

Inserting/deleting after a given node (if you have a pointer to that node) is O(1).

No Memory Waste (Typically): Memory is allocated exactly as needed for each node, so there's no unused allocated capacity as there might be in dynamic arrays.

Flexible Structure: Can be adapted to various forms (doubly, circular) to support different traversal needs.

Cons:

No Random Access (Slow Access by Index): To access the Nth element, you must traverse the list from the head, taking O(N) time. This is the biggest disadvantage compared to arrays.

More Memory Usage per Element: Each node requires extra memory to store the pointer(s) to the next (and/or previous) node(s), in addition to the data itself. This overhead can be significant for lists of small data types.

Greater Implementation Complexity: Implementing linked list operations (especially deletion, reversal, or dealing with sub-lists) often requires careful pointer manipulation and can be more error-prone than array operations.

Less Cache Friendly: Due to non-contiguous memory, elements might be scattered, leading to poorer cache performance compared to arrays.

7. Common Use Cases / Applications

Implementing Stacks and Queues: Linked lists provide efficient O(1) push/pop (for stacks) and enqueue/dequeue (for queues) operations.

Adjacency Lists in Graphs: A common way to represent graphs, where each vertex has a linked list of its neighbors.

Hash Table Collision Handling: Separate Chaining, a common method for handling hash collisions, uses linked lists to store elements that hash to the same bucket.

Implementing LRU Cache: Doubly linked lists are often used to maintain the order of recently used items for O(1) access/update, combined with a hash map.

Memory Management: Used by operating systems to manage free blocks of memory.

Undo/Redo Functionality: Can be implemented with doubly linked lists.

Polynomial Representation: Each term in a polynomial can be a node in a linked list.

8. Related Concepts / Variations

Arrays: The primary alternative for sequential data storage. Understanding their trade-offs is key.

Pointers / References: The fundamental concept that enables linked lists.

Stacks: Can be implemented using linked lists.

Queues: Can be implemented using linked lists.

Fast & Slow Pointers: A crucial pattern for linked lists, used for cycle detection and finding middle nodes.

In-place Reversal: A common and important linked list manipulation technique.

Dummy Nodes (Sentinel Nodes): A common trick to simplify linked list code.

Recursion: Many linked list traversals and manipulations can be elegantly expressed recursively (though iterative is often preferred for space in Python due to recursion depth).
