# DS_Algo_Practice_Python

This repository serves as a comprehensive, self-contained guide and practice ground for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python.

It aims to be a standalone resource, providing theoretical notes, Python implementation details, and dedicated spaces for LeetCode solutions.

## Structure:

*   `00_Python_For_DSA/`: Notes on Python features highly relevant for DSA.
*   `01_Big_O_Notation_Complexity/`: Understanding algorithm efficiency.
*   `02_Core_Data_Structures/`: Implementations and notes for fundamental data structures.
*   `03_Core_Algorithms_And_Techniques/`: Implementations and notes for core algorithms and algorithmic paradigms.
*   `04_Common_Problem_Solving_Patterns/`: Detailed notes on frequently used problem-solving patterns.
*   `LeetCode_Problems_Categorized/`: Organized solutions to LeetCode problems.
*   `_Templates_And_Utilities/`: Useful scripts, templates, and setup notes.
